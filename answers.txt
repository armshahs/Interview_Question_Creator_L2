Question: 17. Why are oceans and marine resources vital for sustainable development, and what issues are currently threatening them?
Answer:Oceans and marine resources are vital for sustainable development because they support the livelihoods of more than 3 billion people who depend on marine and coastal diversity. They play a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate, absorbing about 30 percent of the carbon dioxide produced by humans, and providing essential resources such as food and clean water.

Currently, several issues are threatening oceans and marine resources, including:

1. Overexploitation: Nearly a third of the world's fish stocks are overexploited, which is not sustainable for future generations.
2. Ocean Acidification: The increase in carbon dioxide levels has made the oceans 26% more acidic since the start of the industrial revolution, affecting marine life.
3. Pollution: There is significant pollution in the oceans, with an estimated 13,000 pieces of plastic litter on every square kilometer of ocean, which harms marine ecosystems.

These challenges highlight the need for effective management and protection of marine resources to ensure their sustainability for future generations.

Question: 18. What is the importance of terrestrial ecosystems, and what goals are set to protect and restore them by 2030?
Answer:Terrestrial ecosystems are crucial because they provide essential services such as food, clean air, clean water, and play a significant role in combating climate change. Plant life constitutes 80% of the human diet, and forests, which cover 30% of the Earth's surface, help maintain air and water quality and support millions of animal species. However, these ecosystems are under threat, with arable land disappearing rapidly, deserts spreading, and many animal breeds going extinct.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to protect, restore, and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems by 2030. This includes conserving and restoring forests, wetlands, drylands, and mountains to ensure their sustainability and the biodiversity they support.
